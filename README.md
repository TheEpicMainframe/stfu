# Probably Octo Journey: CPSC 233 Project


# Running the demo

```
git clone https://github.com/jaredponn/probable-octo-journey
cd probable-octo-journey
./run.sh 
```

Note: this script only works with bash.

# Version number:
-2019 February 24, Version 1.0 Pre-Alpha unstable release
-2019 March 11, Version 1.1 Pre-Alpha half-stable release

# Directory structure
```bash
src/    # source files
src/poj # game engine
src/*   # game
```

# Architecture
The architecture uses and entity component system. More information on the architecture can be found here from https://jaredponn.github.io/.


# Announcements:
- The coordinate system is a little strange. The following diagram will illustrate:
```
     (-y / S)      (-x / W)
             \      /
              '    /
               \  /
                '/ (0,0)
                /\
               /  '
              /    \
             /      ' (+y / mapHeight / N )
  (+x / mapWidth / E)

- 1 mapWidth is one length of the x direction
- 1 mapHeight is one length of the y direction


```

- Using Optional in Java (should be used for all values that may or may not exist):
```Java
Optional<Double> a = Optional.of(3d); // initilizes with value of 3
                // = Optional.empty(); // initlizes with no value
if (a.isEmpty())
{
	// handle error
}
else
{
	// do whatever
	a.get() // gets the value
}

// 2 ways to test if the value exists or not respectively
// .isPresent() / isEmpty()
```

Majority of the collision algorithms were from or built upon *Real-Time Collision Detection* by Christer Ericson, published by Morgan Kaufmann Publishers, Copyright 2005 Elsevier Inc.


The game engine design came from various posts and contributions from: https://jaredponn.github.io/ and from the project https://github.com/jaredponn/improved-octo-waffle
